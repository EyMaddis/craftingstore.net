craftingstore.net
=================

The sources for the abandon craftingstore.net. It is a almost fully functional shop management system for Bukkit based Minecraft game servers.


Development began in summer 2011 and january 2014. 

It's based on the [Smarty Template Engine](http://www.smarty.net/) and a custom MVC inspired framework.

Because it began as a student project it had some structural developmental bootlenecks. Yet it has several optimations and runs pretty smooth on an apache webserver with memcache etc.
